### What I learned

Transitions on Gradients don't work out of the box, so you have to work around it using pseudo elements and z-index.

### Continued development

Still need to break down the design more into smaller chunks. Several times resulted in a small rewrite of code which wouldnt have happened had I spent another few moments looking at how to break it down.
